# eJPT Journey — No Shortcuts

This repository documents my **hands-on preparation for the eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)** certification.

Everything here reflects **real lab work, manual enumeration, and practical penetration testing methodology** — no shortcuts, no copy-paste walkthroughs.

---

# 🎯 Objective

Build strong foundational penetration testing skills through:

- Real lab environments  
- Manual enumeration  
- Vulnerability discovery  
- Exploitation practice  
- Professional documentation  

---

# 🚀 What This Repository Shows

This repository demonstrates my ability to:

- Perform full-service enumeration on target systems  
- Identify misconfigurations and exposed services  
- Analyze real vulnerabilities in lab environments  
- Navigate Linux systems and restricted shells  
- Document findings in a structured, professional format  

---

# 🧪 Lab Environment

**Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux  
**Target Machine:** Metasploitable 2  
**Platform:** VMware Workstation  

All testing is performed in a **controlled and isolated lab environment**.

---

# 🔥 Highlighted Work

## 🧪 Pickle Rick (TryHackMe)
- Discovered hidden credentials via **page source inspection**
- Extracted sensitive data from **robots.txt**
- Performed **directory enumeration** to uncover hidden endpoints
- Gained access to a **web-based command execution interface**
- Navigated system directories to retrieve sensitive files under restricted conditions

---

## 🖥️ Metasploitable 2 Enumeration

Performed full attack surface analysis:

- Identified open services (FTP, SMB, HTTP, SSH)
- Discovered **anonymous SMB shares with read/write access**
- Enumerated web directories:
  - `/phpMyAdmin`
  - `/dav`
  - `/test`
- Detected outdated services:
  - Apache 2.2.8  
  - PHP 5.2.4  
  - vsFTPd 2.3.4  
- Confirmed findings using:
  - Nikto  
  - Manual banner grabbing (Netcat)  

---

# 🔍 What I've Covered

## Reconnaissance & Enumeration

- Network discovery using Nmap  
- Full port scanning  
- Service/version detection  
- SMB share enumeration  
- HTTP directory brute forcing (dirb)  
- Vulnerability scanning (Nikto)  
- Manual enumeration (Netcat)  

---

## ⚙️ Attacker Infrastructure Setup

- Python HTTP server for payload delivery  
- Reverse shell preparation  
- Basic service hosting  

---

# 🧰 Tools Used

- Nmap  
- Dirb  
- Nikto  
- Netcat  
- SMBClient  
- FTP  
- Python HTTP Server  
- Linux CLI tools

# 🧠 Methodology

My workflow follows a structured penetration testing process:

1. Reconnaissance  
2. Service Enumeration  
3. Attack Surface Analysis  
4. Vulnerability Identification  
5. Exploitation  
6. Post-Exploitation  
7. Documentation

# 🧩 Skills Demonstrated (With Evidence)

| Skill | Evidence |
|------|--------|
| SMB Enumeration | Anonymous share access discovered |
| Web Enumeration | Hidden directories found using dirb |
| Vulnerability Detection | Outdated Apache & PHP identified |
| Manual Enumeration | Banner grabbing using netcat |
| Linux Navigation | Retrieved files via restricted shell |

---

# 📈 Progress Status

**Current Phase:** Enumeration & Attack Surface Analysis  

**Next Focus:**
- Service exploitation  
- Reverse shells  
- Privilege escalation  

---

# 📸 Documentation Approach

Each lab includes:

- Commands used  
- Output analysis  
- Screenshots  
- Key findings  
- Lessons learned  

---

# 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- Understand tools deeply, not just use them  
- Focus on manual techniques  
- Document everything professionally  
- Build real-world thinking
